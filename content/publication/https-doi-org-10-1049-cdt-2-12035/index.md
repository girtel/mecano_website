abstract: Abstract Deep learning (DL) techniques have been extensively studied to
  improve their precision and scalability in a vast range of applications. Recently,
  a new milestone has been reached driven by the emergence of the TinyDL paradigm,
  which enables adaptation of complex DL models generated by well-known libraries
  to the restrictions of constrained microcontroller-based devices. In this work,
  a comprehensive discussion is provided regarding this novel ecosystem, by identifying
  the benefits that it will bring to the wearable industry and analysing different
  TinyDL initiatives promoted by tech giants. The specific use case of automatic user
  recognition from data captured by a wearable device is also presented. The whole
  development process by which different DL configurations have been embedded in a
  real microcontroller unit is described. The attained results in terms of accuracy
  and resource usage confirm the validity of the proposal, which allows precise predictions
  in a highly constrained platform with limited input information. Therefore, this
  work provides insights into the viability of the integration of TinyDL models within
  wearables, which may be valuable for researchers, practitioners, and makers related
  to this industry.
