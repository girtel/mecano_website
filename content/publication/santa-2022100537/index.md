abstract: Cellular vehicle to everything (C-V2X) communications is presented as the
  cornerstone for next-generation connected vehicles. C-V2X can support efficient
  vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure data transmission, and is said
  to be a key enabler of cooperative connected and automated mobility (CCAM). Performance
  of 5G New Radio (5G-NR) is expected to address bandwidth and delay requirements
  of services for autonomous vehicles. This is the theory and what particular research
  works have showed through simulation or limited prototypes. On the contrary, this
  work focuses on evaluating real 5G deployments (including 5G-NR) of network operators
  in CCAM scenarios, with particular emphasis on cross-border settings and service
  continuity under inter-operator handovers. The paper presents an evaluation platform
  to gather cross-layer measurements, homogenise results, perform comparative assessment
  of figures of merit, and calculate network and CCAM key performance indicators (KPIs).
  The platform is evaluated through implementing a use case for autonomous overtaking,
  involving two 5G-NR operator deployments at the Spanish-Portuguese border. Results
  reveal good network performances and correct operation of the service, thanks to
  5G-NR and edge servers, although significant impact of handovers is detected on
  network and overtaking KPIs.
