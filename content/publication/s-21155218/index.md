abstract: The penetration of wearable devices in our daily lives is unstoppable. Although
  they are very popular, so far, these elements provide a limited range of services
  that are mostly focused on monitoring tasks such as fitness, activity, or health
  tracking. Besides, given their hardware and power constraints, wearable units are
  dependent on a master device, e.g., a smartphone, to make decisions or send the
  collected data to the cloud. However, a new wave of both communication and artificial
  intelligence (AI)-based technologies fuels the evolution of wearables to an upper
  level. Concretely, they are the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) and tiny machine-learning
  (TinyML) technologies. This paper reviews and discusses these solutions, and explores
  the major implications and challenges of this technological transformation. Finally,
  the results of an experimental study are presented, analyzing (i) the long-range
  connectivity gained by a wearable device in a university campus scenario, thanks
  to the integration of LPWAN communications, and (ii) how complex the intelligence
  embedded in this wearable unit can be. This study shows the interesting characteristics
  brought by these state-of-the-art paradigms, concluding that a wide variety of novel
  services and applications will be supported by the next generation of wearables.
