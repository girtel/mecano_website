title: First tests with the OBU prototype
date: 2022-03-31
draft: false
abstract: "The development of the MECANO OBU has reached the validation stage. The final prototype gathers environmental data about air pollution and other relevant parameters. Data is then sent to a server hosted in the GIRTEL group by using a whole LoRaWAN deployment and a proper database and visualization tool. The validation has been completed using an e-scooter to be ridden around the city centre, in the surroundings of the university campuses, providing a green mobility solution and a mobile crowdsensing unit."
