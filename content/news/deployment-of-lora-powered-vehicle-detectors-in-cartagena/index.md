We have just finished the first stage in the deployment of infrastructure sensors to “sense” the city of Cartagena. A set of vehicle detectors have been installed at three streets of Cartagena. Together with a third point, which is pending, these sensors allow us to measure traffic flows entering or exiting the city centre. This is a milestone in the collection of mobility information, since this information will be used to implement sustainable mobility services through real software and simulation tools.
