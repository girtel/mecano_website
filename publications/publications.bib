abstract = {Cellular vehicle to everything (C-V2X) communications is presented as the cornerstone for next-generation connected vehicles. C-V2X can support efficient vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure data transmission, and is said to be a key enabler of cooperative connected and automated mobility (CCAM). Performance of 5G New Radio (5G-NR) is expected to address bandwidth and delay requirements of services for autonomous vehicles. This is the theory and what particular research works have showed through simulation or limited prototypes. On the contrary, this work focuses on evaluating real 5G deployments (including 5G-NR) of network operators in CCAM scenarios, with particular emphasis on cross-border settings and service continuity under inter-operator handovers. The paper presents an evaluation platform to gather cross-layer measurements, homogenise results, perform comparative assessment of figures of merit, and calculate network and CCAM key performance indicators (KPIs). The platform is evaluated through implementing a use case for autonomous overtaking, involving two 5G-NR operator deployments at the Spanish-Portuguese border. Results reveal good network performances and correct operation of the service, thanks to 5G-NR and edge servers, although significant impact of handovers is detected on network and overtaking KPIs.}

abstract = {The expansion of the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT) leads to limitless and continuous working playgrounds exploited by highly dynamic end devices. This requires the adoption of multi-Radio Access Technologies (RATs)-based strategies to provide IoMT units with ubiquitous connectivity. To this end, the development of secure bootstrapping and authentication mechanisms is necessary to permit the secure operation of end devices. Given the transmission and power limitations of these elements, current cryptographic solutions do not address these stringent requirements. For that reason, in the study we present a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)-based end-to-end architecture that enables an efficient and secure authentication and key agreement between end devices and network servers over heterogeneous resource-limited networks such as the Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). Our proposal is based on the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) architecture and the recent Internet Engineering Task Force initiatives Static Context Header Compression and Low-Overhead CoAP-EAP. The results obtained from experimental tests reveal the validity of the proposal as it enables constrained IoMT devices to gain IPv6 connectivity as well as performs end-to-end secure authentication with notable reliability and controlled latency.}

abstract = {Abstract Deep learning (DL) techniques have been extensively studied to improve their precision and scalability in a vast range of applications. Recently, a new milestone has been reached driven by the emergence of the TinyDL paradigm, which enables adaptation of complex DL models generated by well-known libraries to the restrictions of constrained microcontroller-based devices. In this work, a comprehensive discussion is provided regarding this novel ecosystem, by identifying the benefits that it will bring to the wearable industry and analysing different TinyDL initiatives promoted by tech giants. The specific use case of automatic user recognition from data captured by a wearable device is also presented. The whole development process by which different DL configurations have been embedded in a real microcontroller unit is described. The attained results in terms of accuracy and resource usage confirm the validity of the proposal, which allows precise predictions in a highly constrained platform with limited input information. Therefore, this work provides insights into the viability of the integration of TinyDL models within wearables, which may be valuable for researchers, practitioners, and makers related to this industry.},

ABSTRACT = {The penetration of wearable devices in our daily lives is unstoppable. Although they are very popular, so far, these elements provide a limited range of services that are mostly focused on monitoring tasks such as fitness, activity, or health tracking. Besides, given their hardware and power constraints, wearable units are dependent on a master device, e.g., a smartphone, to make decisions or send the collected data to the cloud. However, a new wave of both communication and artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies fuels the evolution of wearables to an upper level. Concretely, they are the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) and tiny machine-learning (TinyML) technologies. This paper reviews and discusses these solutions, and explores the major implications and challenges of this technological transformation. Finally, the results of an experimental study are presented, analyzing (i) the long-range connectivity gained by a wearable device in a university campus scenario, thanks to the integration of LPWAN communications, and (ii) how complex the intelligence embedded in this wearable unit can be. This study shows the interesting characteristics brought by these state-of-the-art paradigms, concluding that a wide variety of novel services and applications will be supported by the next generation of wearables.},

ABSTRACT = {A new wave of electric vehicles for personal mobility is currently crowding public spaces. They offer a sustainable and efficient way of getting around in urban environments, however, these devices bring additional safety issues, including serious accidents for riders. Thereby, taking advantage of a connected personal mobility vehicle, we present a novel on-device Machine Learning (ML)-based fall detection system that analyzes data captured from a range of sensors integrated on an on-board unit (OBU) prototype. Given the typical processing limitations of these elements, we exploit the potential of the TinyML paradigm, which enables embedding powerful ML algorithms in constrained units. We have generated and publicly released a large dataset, including real riding measurements and realistically simulated falling events, which has been employed to produce different TinyML models. The attained results show the good operation of the system to detect falls efficiently using embedded OBUs. The considered algorithms have been successfully tested on mass-market low-power units, implying reduced energy consumption, flash footprints and running times, enabling new possibilities for this kind of vehicles.},
